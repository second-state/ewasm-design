# Ethereum Environment Interface (EEI) Specification

The Ethereum Environment Interface exposes the core Ethereum API to the ewasm environment. The Ethereum [module](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Modules.md) will be implemented in the Ethereum client's native language. All parameters and returns are restricted to 32 or 64 bit integers. Floats are disallowed.

# Data types

We define the following Ethereum data types:
- `bytes`: an array of bytes with unrestricted length
- `bytes32`: an array of 32 bytes
- `address`: an array of 20 bytes
- `u128`: a 128 bit number, represented as a 16 bytes long little endian unsigned integer in memory
- `u256`: a 256 bit number, represented as a 32 bytes long little endian unsigned integer in memory

We also define the following WebAssembly data types:
- `i32`: same as `i32` in WebAssembly
- `i32ptr`: same as `i32` in WebAssembly, but treated as a pointer to a WebAssembly memory offset
- `i64`: same as `i64` in WebAssembly
